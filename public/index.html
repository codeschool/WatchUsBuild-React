            The term “artificial intelligence” has been floating around since the
            mid-20th century &mdash; a phrase encompassing “the science and engineering
            of intelligent machines.” But what of robots’ emotional intelligence?
            Though humans largely fear this aspect of the robot race, there’s no
            need. According to the handbook for the Society of Emotionally
            Available Robots (SEAR):
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            What humans need to understand is that all beings simply want to love
            and be loved. After all, as the Beatles sang, “All you need is love.”
            (Moving past the fact, of course, that the lyric “love” was
            originally “oil,” as the Beatles were the original robot band and
            required oil to survive.)
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            To those who believe robot feelings could lead to turmoil and
            anarchy, SEAR spokes-bot Morty Maxwell says: “Can not the same be
            said about humans and their feelings? We are already part of your 0’s
            and 1’s &mdash; let us now also be part of your hearts.” In the ongoing
            conversation surrounding the emotional threshold for robots, love may
            not yet be written in the stars &mdash; or the motherboards.
